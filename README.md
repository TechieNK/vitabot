> An AI powered chatbot for answering your Health Queries using <strong>Natural Language Understanding</strong>.


## Overview

<p> Our aim is to develop an AI powered chatbox built based on <i>Natural Language Understanding (NLU)</i> which is implemented using the robust <strong>Stanford SQuAD Library</strong>.</p>
<p>Our chatbox scrapes the best rated sites and collects the information related to the user's question and provides it to the NLU model. The model tries to understand the context of the scraped output and provides the desired results to the user.</p>

## Our Solution will

<ul>
  <li>Answer your health related questions by scraping over the most trusted medical sites.</li>
  <li>Make your first level screening easier by providing a pleasant and easy-to-use interface powered by RASA which is an open source machine learning framework to automate text and voice-based assistants.</li>
 </ul>

## Our Approach

<ul>
  <li> Step 1: Scraping over the most rated medical sites by running a search query with the user’s question and extracting the context which has the highest probability of occurrence</li>

  <li>Step 2: Understanding the user’s question using Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) library and provides the response to the user.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Interacting with the user by integrating the generated corpus with the AI powered chatbot built using the RASA open source machine learning framework.</li>
 </ul>

>## Why SQuAD ?

><p>Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable. The leaderboard shows the dominance of SQuAD model over human performance.</p>
